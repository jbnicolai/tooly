# tooly

(work in progress)

> javascript utility library covering everything from dom selection and css manipulation,
> object inheritance and extension, logging, event handling, string formatting, etc. 
> Basically everything that I usually want/need at my fingertips for any given project.
> Compatible with node, amd, and modern browsers. 
> Just under 4kb minified and gzipped 
> (~3kb without the `logger` and `timer` modules, 
> which shouldn't be used in production anyway - see `dist/tooly-slim.js`). 

## Install

```bash
$ npm install git+https://git@github.com/Lokua/tooly.git
```

## Documentation

## Custom Build
  
You can create a custom build of particular categories.

```bash
cd path_to/node_modules/tooly
# from the tooly module root, install dev dependecies
npm install
# run the script and `include` command
# passing as arguments modules you want included 
# this will also run related Grunt umd and uglify tasks
bin/build include logger timer string
# run the `grunt custom` task to minify the new build
grunt custom
```

Available categories include:
+ `collections`
+ `frankie` (jQuery-like dom selection)
+ `logger`
+ `object` 
+ `string`
+ `timer` 
+ `xhr`

By default the custom build will be located at `./dist/tooly-custom.js`, or alternatively, you
can specify a custom output file during the build instruction:

```bash
bin/build include dom string -o my-custom-tooly-build.js && grunt custom
```
